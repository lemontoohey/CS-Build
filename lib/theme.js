// Shared design tokens for the whole app.
//
// The two greys come straight from ironcove.com.au: BRAND_BLUE is the
// pale slate-blue sampled from their logo (used for the "CS Build" brand
// mark and site navigation — wayfinding, not actions), and BODY_TEXT is the
// near-black grey their own body copy uses.
//
// ACCENT is "vermillion" (rgb(155,27,21), labelled "classical deep cadmium
// red" in Liam's Camille_website project) — used only for actionable
// buttons, so red always means "you can click this."
//
// BUTTON_CLASSES is the one place every action button's look comes from:
// a soft lift + shadow on hover and a brief press-down on click, in plain
// CSS transitions. Deliberately does NOT copy that project's sliding
// colour-wipe fill effect — kept simple on purpose.
